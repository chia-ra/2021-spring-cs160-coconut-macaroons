# HoneyComb 
This is an ecommerce application that is created using; NodeJS, EJF, and MongoDB as our database. This application mainly targets college students who need to sell or purchase school supplies, books, and notes.

## Features
Features include the standard login and signup procedure. After logging in, users have the option to create posts (including a title, image, and description), update posts, and delete posts. Users can also view other posts and leave a comment. Sellers and Customers can communicate through the website.

## How to set up the application
Create a folder on your machine
Open terminal and go to the folder
Checkout the master branch into the folder
Run `npm start` on the same terminal
On a web browser, enter `localhost:8080/apparel` in the search bar

## How we use branching
We create a new branch for each sprint and occasionally make sub branches in order to avoid merge conflicts while people are concurrently pushing changes to the same parts of the project.
